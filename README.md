                  A travel brochure using html and css

Description about the project:

The purpose of this project is to create a single page brochure for a travelling agency. The definition of a travel brochure, is a brochure often form a travel agency to provide information about packages, hotels etc. This can be used as a tool to attract more customers.  The technology that has been used for implementation is Bootstrap (HTML & CSS).


Things I have learned (07.03.2020):

I have learned a lot from this project. The very first thing that I learned was to make the webpage simple and accessible to the target community rather than making it complex. I have also learned that to build a proper project it is very much important to plan perfectly. The project helped me to learn HTML and CSS more and better with clarity.


Things to do differently to update or improve the site:

	In addition to just providing information about what can a person see if they choose the particular destination, we call tell them why will enjoy visiting them.

	Be creative by giving information about what the places are known for, how those places were discovered and by whom.

	Try to capture the latest news first so that we can gain attraction.

	Keep the website simple and unique to capture the interests of the target customers.

	Make it easy for the users to raise queries and provide a response to them in a shorter period.

	To make the website more interactive we can add chatbot too.

	Give ideas to make the trip a memorable and an enjoyable one (recreational and outdoor activities).

	To have happy customers we can offer discounts to those who travel often.

	If needed we can look into the purpose of travel and provide information on relevant places matching that occasion in the chosen destination.

	Instead of just providing the travel brochure we can offer online booking facilities as well.
