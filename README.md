                  A travel brochure using html and css

<b>Description about the project:</b>

The purpose of this project is to create a single page brochure for a travelling agency. The definition of a travel brochure, is a brochure from a travel agency to provide information about packages, hotels etc. This can be even used as a tool to attract more customers.The technology that has been used for implementation is Bootstrap (HTML & CSS).


<b>Things I have learned (07.03.2020):</b>

I have learned a lot from this project. The very first thing that I learned was to make the webpage simple and accessible to the target community rather than making it complex. I have also learned that in order to build a proper project it is very much important to plan perfectly. This project helped me to learn HTML and CSS more and better with clarity.

<b>Mistakes that I have made in this project:</b>

	I should have named the page as index.html since it is the standard for any home page.

	Instead of using b and i for bold and italics I must have used the CSS styles as they would be semantically correct.

	I must have used doctype in my project else the browser may make assumptions about the type.

	Should have used an alt attribute so that if the image is missing some text could be displayed.

	The code could have been more compact.

	Instead of white space in the background, I could have put some suitable background colour.

	I must have added some comments to my code so that it could be understood by anyone who reads the same.

	I should have tested it in other systems rather than only checking it at my system to make sure it works fine everywhere.

	I shoudn't have used used libraries as it will make the website heavy (in case of larger websites).

	Should have saved all the images using .png extension as it is a lossless compression file format.


<b>Things to do differently to update or improve the site:</b>

	In addition to just providing information about what can a person see if they choose the particular destination, we can tell why they will enjoy visiting them.

	Be creative by giving information about what the places are known for, how those places were discovered and by whom.

	Try to capture the latest news first so that we can gain attraction.

	Keep the website simple and unique to capture the interests of the target customers.

	Make it easy for the users to raise queries and provide a response in a shorter period.

	To make the website more interactive we can add chatbot too.

	Give ideas to make the trip a memorable and an enjoyable one (recreational and outdoor activities).

	To have happy customers we can offer discounts to those who travel often.

	If needed we can look into the purpose of travel and provide information on relevant places matching that occasion in the chosen destination.

	Instead of just providing the travel brochure we can offer online booking facilities as well.

I would like to start off by appreciating how good the sight looks 
and this is a brilliant idea.
I liked your idea of putting a logo to the website and 
adding the rating for each destination is a good idea.
Though the 10 things I personally feel that can be improved are:

1. Add some JavaScript content to the page.
2. Align all the picture boxes at the same level.
3. Add some navigation to the site.
4. Align the description of the text properly.
5. Try not repeating the same content for each destination.
6. Leave spaces between icons and text. 
7. Use of different styling fonts.
8. Could have added a background.
9. alt attribute for images could have been added.
10. Make sure your spellings are correct.
